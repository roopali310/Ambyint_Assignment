STEP 5










Problem2: Which Movie had the longest timespan from release to appearing on Netflix?
Solution:
CREATE VIEW Longest_Timespan AS
    
With Time_to_Netflix   as
(
SELECT title,
  ((substring(date_added, -4, 4)) - release_year) as time_to_show
FROM
  NETFLIX_DATA ) 
  select (time_to_show), title from Time_to_Netflix order by time_to_show desc
  ;










Problem3: Which Month of the year had the most new releases historically?
Solution:
             create view New_Release_MonthYear (Count_of_Movies, Release_Date) as
              select count(RELEASE_DATE) as cnt, RELEASE_DATE from  
              (
                SELECT 
                (SPLIT_PART(NETFLIX_DATA.date_added::string, ' ', 1) || 
                SUBSTR(date_added, -4)) AS RELEASE_DATE
                FROM 
                NETFLIX_DATA 
                )
               group by RELEASE_DATE order by cnt desc 
               ;


























Problem 4: Which year had the largest increase year on year (percentage wise) for TV Shows?
Solution:
create view Largest_Increase_On_Year (Movie_Count, Release_Year,            Percent_year) as
select count(RELEASE_DATE) as cnt, RELEASE_DATE,
((CNT - LAG(CNT) OVER (ORDER BY release_date))/(LAG(CNT) OVER (ORDER BY release_date))*100) AS diff_to_prev
  from  
(
  SELECT 
    --(SPLIT_PART(NETFLIX_DATA.date_added::string, ' ', 1) || 
    SUBSTR(date_added, -4) AS RELEASE_DATE  
  FROM 
   NETFLIX_DATA where type='TV Show' 
   )
 group by RELEASE_DATE order by diff_to_prev desc 
;
